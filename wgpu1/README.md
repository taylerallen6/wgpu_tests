# Wgpu 1

This is an exact copy of the of the code from the [Learn Wgpu - The Pipeline tutorial](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/beginner/tutorial3-pipeline/#what-s-a-pipeline) with the source code being [here](https://github.com/sotrh/learn-wgpu/tree/master/code/beginner/tutorial3-pipeline). It is not my code at all. I highly recommend going through the tutorial. It helps explain each part of the Wgpu pipeline and how it works. It should be noted that this focuses more on grphics and does not address how to use wgpu for compute shaders. While the overall process is similar, there are some differences. For examples on using Wgpu for compute shaders, please look through my other examples.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Rust - you need rust on your machine to run this program. If you do not have rust, the installation process is very simple and can be found [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
