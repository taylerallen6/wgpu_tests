# Image Compute 1

THIS CODE CURRENTLY CONTAINS BUGS AND WILL NOT WORK. I AM STILL WORKING ON IT AND AM ALWAYS OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS.

This is a simple program to convert an image from color to grey scale using Wgpu. This program is adapted and updated from my [image_compute_default](https://github.com/taylerallen6/Wgpu_examples) program which is based on [Beno√Æt Vermont's blog post and code](https://blog.redwarp.app/image-filters/).

I wrote this to find and demonstrate the simplest way to process an image using Wgpu.

## Getting Started

### Installing

Installation is as simple as git cloning the parent repository containing this program.

### Executing program

How to run the program:
